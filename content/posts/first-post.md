## Intro
I've been hosting my personal blog on Ghost for about 4 years and originally I chose ghost because it was the "wordpress killer" and seemed pretty easy to deploy and use! Deploying ghost was a fun project and allowed me to learn how to do deploy ghost onto Kubernetes and even contribute a marketplace app for it! Well it's been 2 years since my last blog post which is shameful! So time for a fresh start and with it I decided to go to with the popular method of static site deployment, one because I enjoy trying new (to me) technology and two github pages is free!
